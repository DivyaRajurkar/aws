# AWS Key Pair Overview

## What is a Key Pair?

A **key pair** in AWS is a security credential used to securely log in to your EC2 instances. It consists of two parts:

1. **Public Key**: Stored on the EC2 instance by AWS.
2. **Private Key**: Downloaded and kept by the user to authenticate and access the instance.

## How It Works

- The **public key** stays on the server (EC2 instance).
- The **private key** is used by the user to establish a secure connection via SSH.
- Only someone with the correct private key can access the instance.

## Example

When launching an EC2 instance, you create or select a key pair. You use the private key file (e.g., `my-key.pem`) to connect to the instance securely.

## Important Notes

- Keep the private key safe; AWS cannot regenerate it for you.
- If you lose the private key, you'll lose SSH access to the instance unless you create a workaround (e.g., creating a new key pair and adding its public key to the instance).

This ensures secure access to your AWS resources.
