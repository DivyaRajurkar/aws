# Security Groups in AWS

## Q2) What is a Security Group?

A **security group** in AWS acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances and other resources. It controls inbound and outbound traffic to ensure secure communication.

### Key Points:
1. **Inbound Rules**: Define the traffic allowed **into** the resource.  
2. **Outbound Rules**: Define the traffic allowed **out** of the resource.  
3. **Stateful**: If you allow traffic in one direction, the response traffic is automatically allowed in the opposite direction.  
4. **Assigned to Resources**: You can attach one or more security groups to EC2 instances, RDS databases, or other services.  

### Example in Day-to-Day Life:
Imagine your house:  
1. **Inbound Rules**: You allow friends to enter through the main door (specific people).  
2. **Outbound Rules**: You allow family members to leave for work (specific people leaving).  
3. **Stateful**: If a friend is allowed in, they are also allowed to leave without needing extra permission.

In AWS:
- You allow **port 22** (SSH) for trusted people (developers) to log in.  
- You allow **port 80** (HTTP) for anyone to view your website.  
- Only the rules you set determine who can access your resources or services, keeping them safe.
